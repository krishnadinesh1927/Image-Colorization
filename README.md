# Image Colourization

Welcome to the Grayscale Image Colorization project repository! This project is dedicated to the fascinating task of colorizing grayscale images using advanced deep learning techniques. Our focus is on employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to transform monochrome images into their vibrant, colorized counterparts.

## Project Overview

Objective: To convert grayscale images into their colorized counterparts, enhancing their aesthetic and artistic value.

Target Audience: Ideal for artists, photographers, and technologists interested in the intersection of AI and image processing.

# Technical Stack and Methodologies

## Languages:

Python: Primary programming language, known for its efficiency and library support in AI and data science.

## Libraries & Frameworks:

TensorFlow & Keras: For building and training the CNN model.

PIL (Python Imaging Library): For image manipulation and processing.

OpenCV: Utilized for advanced image processing tasks.

Scikit-image: For image color space transformations.

Matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing images.

Tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).

## AI/ML Technologies:
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): The backbone of our image colorization model.
Data Augmentation: Enhancing the training process with techniques like shear, zoom, and rotation.

## Development Tools:

Jupyter Notebooks: For iterative coding and testing.
Git & GitHub: For version control and repository hosting.

## Features
