# Grayscale Image Colorization

Welcome to the Grayscale Image Colorization project repository. This project aims to colorize grayscale images using deep learning techniques. It utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to transform black and white images into vibrant color versions.

## Overview

- **Objective:** To convert grayscale images into colorized versions for enhanced visual appeal and artistic creativity.
- **Technology:** Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Python, TensorFlow, Keras.
- **Model:** A CNN-based model for image colorization.

## Features

- Converts black and white images to colorized versions.
- Offers creative possibilities for image enhancement and artistic expression.
- Utilizes data augmentation for training robust models.
- Provides an efficient and accurate solution for grayscale image colorization.
